**Experiment Branch**: `[###-experiment-name]`
**Created**: [DATE]
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: Research question: "$ARGUMENTS"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse research question from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No research question provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: constructs, populations, contexts, measures
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill Experimental Design section
   ‚Üí If no clear hypothesis: ERROR "Cannot determine research hypothesis"
5. Generate Methodology
   ‚Üí Each measure must be validated
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous procedures
6. Identify Data Requirements (sample size, measures)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Design has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If ethics issues found: ERROR "Address ethical concerns"
8. Return: SUCCESS (experiment ready for planning)

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT you're testing and WHY (hypothesis-driven)
- ‚ùå Avoid implementation details (no VR specifics, code structure)
- üß™ Written for research review, not developers
- üìä Statistical power and validity are paramount

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every experiment
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the design
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a research prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "memory study" without paradigm), mark it
3. **Think like a reviewer**: Every vague hypothesis should fail the "testable and falsifiable" checklist
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - Effect sizes and power analysis
   - Inclusion/exclusion criteria
   - Randomization and counterbalancing
   - Control conditions
   - Confounding variables
   - Data quality checks
